# SoloProject_BudgetDifferent
BudgetDifferent is a different way of budgeting. It equates your spending with common items to show you the true value of your money.

BudgetDifferent is an application that is meant to show a different side of money. It quantifies your monthly spending in typical graphs, but it also shows how much of an item you could have gotten with the same amount of money.

The user enters their monthly income, hours worked, and month and year. They can add and delete budgets, as well as add items to those budgets.
